#  Props in React

- **Props** = Properties  
- Props are used to **pass data** from one component to another.


##  Why Use Props?

- To **send data** from **parent** to **child** component
- Makes components **reusable** and **dynamic**


##  Example

### Parent Component

```jsx
function App() {
  return <Welcome name="Maheswari" />;
}
```

### Child Component

```js
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;  // Hello, Maheswari
}
```

- We cannot change props inside the child component.

- Props are immutable.

## Prop Drilling
- Prop Drilling is the process of passing data from a parent component to deeply nested child components via props, even when intermediate components donâ€™t need the data.

It becomes a problem when:

- You have deeply nested components

- You're passing the same props through many levels

- It leads to messy, hard-to-maintain code
